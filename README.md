# RakisUtil - A collection of generic libraries

These libraries have moved to my new [RakisSoftware area](https://github.com/RakissSoftware) on GitHub! All three libraries now have their own repositories and have been published to the [NUGet repository](https://nuget.org):

* [Rakis.Logging](https://github.com/RakisSoftware/Rakis.Logging) is the logging library.
* [Rakis.Args](https://github.com/RakisSoftware/Rakis.Args) is the commandline parsing library.
* [Rakis.Settings](https://github.com/RakisSoftware/Rakis.Settings) is the app-settings library.

(Please note: this is still a Git repository. Even deleting is just another commit-point...)
